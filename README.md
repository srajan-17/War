# Project: War Card Game iOS App

# This project is an iOS app that features a classic implementation of the card game War. The user repeatedly presses the deal button, and two random cards are dealt. One point is awarded to whichever player had the higher value card, the user (Player) or the computer (CPU). The user can restart the game by pressing the restart button. The project can be opened and tested using Xcode on a Mac.

# This project was written using Swift.
